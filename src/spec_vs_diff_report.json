  "summary": "The implementation successfully adds medical-themed background animations to the header section as requested. All requirements from REQ-1 and REQ-2 appear to be implemented based on the diff evidence. The animations include pulse circles (heartbeat effect), flowing horizontal lines, and a heartbeat wave, all positioned behind the header content with proper z-indexing. The animations use OKLCH colors from the brand palette, respect reduced motion preferences, and are integrated into the sticky header structure without modifying layout or navigation.",
