# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Redesign the Services section on the homepage with premium service cards featuring improved layout, typography, and micro-interactions.

**Planned changes:**
- Add centered "Our Services" heading with supporting subtitle
- Replace small icon boxes with large premium service cards containing title, 2-3 line description, and CTA button
- Style cards with rounded corners (16-20px), soft shadows, light backgrounds, and clear typography hierarchy
- Implement 2-column grid layout on desktop with equal-height cards and hover effects (lift, shadow increase, CTA highlight)
- Implement single-column full-width layout on mobile with touch-friendly buttons
- Add micro-interactions: scroll reveal animations, hover lift, button glow effects, and 0.3s smooth transitions
- Style CTA buttons as rounded pills with brand colors, hover scale effect, and optional icons

**User-visible outcome:** The Services section will display as a modern, premium card-based layout with prominent service descriptions, clear call-to-action buttons, smooth animations, and responsive design that adapts beautifully between desktop and mobile views.
